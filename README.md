# User-Product-Recommendation
The dataset used is electronic datasets. This study focuses on recommending products to the users which pleases them by leveraging the reviews of other users. Popularity based, KNN-Means, SVD and Hybrid Filtering algorithms are used. Sigular Value Decomposition model with RMSE value of 0.99 performed better, compared to K-Nearest Neighbours
with Means model with RMSE value of 1.04. The proposed Hybrid Filtering (combination of KNN-Means and SVD) algorithm competed SVD with much lower RMSE value, which recommends precise product recommendations to the users.
